End_Time: Date and time when the accident ended.
City: The city where the accident occurred.
State: The state where the accident occurred.
Additional columns include information on the accident severity, weather conditions, and road characteristics.
Features
City Visualization: Displays the top 10 accident-prone cities on a map.
State Analysis: Bar charts showing the states with the highest and lowest accident cases.
Geolocation: Uses Nominatim to fetch latitude and longitude for cities.
Percentage Analysis: Calculates the percentage of cities with specific accident cases.
Interactive Visualizations: Enhanced visualizations using Plotly for better insights.
Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations:

Top 10 Accident-Prone Cities: A geographical plot marking the top cities with the most accidents.
Bar Charts: Comparative bar charts for accident cases across states, both for the highest and lowest cases.
Geospatial Map: A comprehensive view of accidents across states in the US.
